# Rogue CodeRevision Log & Usage Guidelines

## Overview


- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1204-R1` - Added `ts.Enemy.RegenIntentsOnMove` console variable (default 0) to gate the heavy DistanceField + enemy intent regeneration path in `AGameTurnManagerBase::OnPlayerCommandAccepted_Implementation`, so by default player MOVE commands no longer rebuild the distance field and recompute intents synchronously on every step (keeping performance predictable) while still allowing developers to re-enable the predictive behavior when investigating AI issues (2025-11-21 16:30)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1201-R1` - Extended `Tools/Log/log_summarizer.py` with an AI-focused `--mode player_actions` preset and optional JSON output so assistants can consume concise, structured player command summaries instead of raw logs (2025-11-21 02:30)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1200-R1` - Updated `Tools/Log/log_summarizer.py` to robustly decode UTF-8/UTF-16 CSV logs and correctly parse TurnID for the default “last 3 turns” summarization behavior across environments (2025-11-21 02:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1157-R1` - Restricted GridOccupancySubsystem FOLLOW-UP so only same-team units (and never the player pawn) can override an OriginHold, keeping enemy chains behind the lead pursuer instead of backfilling the player's old cell (2025-11-20 20:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1157-R2` - Relaxed FOLLOW-UP blocking so enemies can also chain into the player’s previous cell (team mismatch allowed if origin is player), rejecting only true team mismatches; this prevents the pursuit chain from breaking and keeps enemies stacked correctly behind the lead chaser (2025-11-20 20:40)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1157-R3` - Added a Chebyshev distance=1 guard to FOLLOW-UP so only adjacent units can step into the origin cell (including player origin) while still allowing player-path chasing; prevents long-range leapfrogs that caused stacking/overlap (2025-11-20 21:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1148-R2` - Block swap moves in UConflictResolverSubsystem::ResolveAllConflicts even when a cell has multiple contenders by downgrading swap participants to WAIT with swap-specific reasons, preventing GridOccupancy deadlocks from A<->B swaps slipping through the conflict path (2025-11-20 19:05)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1154-R1` - Applied the same corner-cutting rule used by the distance field and LOS checks to `UEnemyAISubsystem::FindAlternateMoveCells`, so diagonal move candidates are rejected whenever either orthogonal shoulder is blocked, preventing enemies from slipping diagonally around wall corners during alternate move selection (2025-11-20 18:30)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1153-R1` - Updated `UDistanceFieldSubsystem::GetNextStepTowardsPlayer` to prefer a straight step along the X/Y axis when the enemy is exactly aligned with the player and the tile is walkable, so “north of player” enemies advance straight south instead of taking diagonals when a direct path exists (2025-11-20 18:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1152-R1` - Adjusted enemy move ordering and scoring so backline units are processed first in `UEnemyAISubsystem::CollectIntents` and orthogonal steps receive a small score bonus in `ScoreMoveCandidate`, making conflicts over approach tiles resolve in favor of further units with straight-line moves while closer or diagonal-only units are more likely to WAIT (2025-11-20 17:30)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1151-R1` - Tightened enemy move intent generation in `UEnemyAISubsystem` so both primary and alternate move candidates must strictly reduce Chebyshev distance to the player, preventing side-to-side oscillation when an enemy cannot actually get closer (2025-11-20 17:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1150-R1` - Updated `UEnemyAISubsystem::ComputeMoveOrWaitIntent` so primary move candidates treat attacker origin cells (hard-blocked tiles) as blocked alongside already-claimed move targets, ensuring movers pick destinations after attackers have fixed their tiles instead of relying on the conflict resolver to downgrade those moves to WAIT (2025-11-20 16:30)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1144-R1` - Added an idempotency guard inside `UGA_AttackBase::EndAbility` so duplicate completion calls are ignored before any barrier updates, per `FIX_PLAN.md` (2025-11-20 13:30)

- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1142-R1` - Ensure `GA_TurnActionBase` and its attack/wait derivatives send the current `TurnId` in `Gameplay.Event.Turn.Ability.Completed` so downstream turn logic stops processing stale payloads per `FIX_PLAN.md` (2025-11-20 12:30)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1141-R1` - Guard `UGA_MeleeAttack::OnMontageCompleted` against duplicate invocations so a single attack ability cannot end twice, per `FIX_PLAN.md` (2025-11-20 12:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1145-R1` - Prevent stale attack completions from calling `TurnActionBarrierSubsystem::CompleteAction` on the wrong `TurnId` by checking the barrier’s current turn inside `UGA_AttackBase::EndAbility`, avoiding cross-turn pollution of the barrier state (2025-11-20 14:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1146-R1` - Updated `UTurnCommandHandler::ProcessPlayerCommand` and `AGameTurnManagerBase::OnPlayerMoveCompleted` so validated `InputTag_Move` commands still allow downstream MovePrecheck/ACK to run, and attack/turn completions re-derive sequential vs simultaneous enemy flow from cached intents even when no move was accepted, ensuring enemies act after a player attack and the first move of Turn 0 is no longer dropped (2025-11-20 15:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1147-R1` - Rotated melee attackers toward their target in `UGA_MeleeAttack::ActivateAbility` using the cached front-cell location from `ComputeTargetFacingInfo`, so both enemies and the player visually face the struck unit when playing the melee montage (2025-11-20 15:10)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1148-R1` - Relaxed the “block moves into attack tiles” behavior in `UConflictResolverSubsystem::ResolveAllConflicts` so MOVE actions whose target cell is occupied by a stationary unit (attack tile or WAIT) first try to reroute to an adjacent cell that still reduces the distance field before being downgraded to WAIT, preventing enemies that could safely step closer to the player from stalling in place (2025-11-20 15:30)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1149-R1` - Added `LastAcceptedCommandTag` to `AGameTurnManagerBase` and updated `OnPlayerMoveCompleted` to gate its fallback enemy-phase dispatch based on that tag instead of the cached move command, so attack completions reliably trigger enemy actions even after prior move commands in the same or previous turns (2025-11-20 15:45)

- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1126-R1` - Derives sequential/simultaneous flow from cached EnemyIntents via `DoesAnyIntentHaveAttack()` so ATTACK intents never slip through per FIX_PLAN_26.md (2025-11-26 10:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1125-R1` - Blocks move intents from attack tiles and derives bHasAttack from cached intents per FIX_PLAN_25.md (2025-11-25 12:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1124-R1` - Simplifies `ComputeIntent` move handling so CoreResolvePhase arbitrates congested moves per `FIX_PLAN_24.md` (2025-11-24 09:30)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1123-R1` - Rejects DistanceField suggestions that do not reduce the distance to the player as outlined in `FIX_PLAN_23.md` (2025-11-23 12:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-1118-R1` - Implements Priority 2.1 three-pass revalidation so stationary blockers lock out conflicting moves instead of triggering `GridOccupancy` rejection (2025-11-18 13:10)

- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00001-R1` - Added barrier notification before `AGameTurnManagerBase::EndEnemyTurn()` (barrier synchronization fix).
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00001-R2` - Added `WindowId` ACK handling in `APlayerControllerBase::Client_ConfirmCommandAccepted_Implementation`.
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00002-R1` - Added detailed pathfinding retry logic to `DistanceFieldSubsystem::GetNextStepTowardsPlayer()`.
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00003-R1` - Updated `response_note.md` and this file to include "CodeRevision" usage policy (2025-11-14 22:24).
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00004-R1` - Fixed GridOccupancy corruption by dropping stale turn notifications in `OnAttacksFinished` (2025-11-14 22:50).
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00005-R1` - Updated `TurnManager` debug messages to ASCII, updated `DungeonFloorGenerator::BSP_Split` to use latest `stack.Pop()` API (2025-11-14 23:00).
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00006-R1` - Removed unused legacy functions from `AGameTurnManagerBase`: `RunTurn()`, `ProcessPlayerCommand()`, `StartTurnMoves()` (2025-11-15 20:30)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00007-R1` - Removed obsolete ability tracking functions (`NotifyAbilityStarted()`, `OnAbilityCompleted()`, `WaitForAbilityCompletion_Implementation()`) and AI pipeline functions (`BuildObservations_Implementation()`, `ComputeEnemyIntent_Implementation()`) replaced by `UTurnActionBarrierSubsystem` and `EnemyAISubsystem`. Updated `GA_WaitBase` to use Barrier subsystem exclusively (2025-11-15 21:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00008-R1` - Removed Blueprint-exposed wall manipulation functions (`SetWallCell()`, `SetWallAtWorldPosition()`, `SetWallRect()`) from `AGameTurnManagerBase`. Removed duplicate input window functions (`OpenInputWindowForPlayer()`, `CloseInputWindowForPlayer()`) and unified input window management through `UPlayerInputProcessor` API (`OpenInputWindow()`, `CloseInputWindow()`). Updated call sites in `NotifyPlayerPossessed()` and `OnPlayerCommandAccepted_Implementation()` to use the unified API (2025-11-15 22:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00009-R1` - Removed redundant wrapper functions `TM_ReturnGridStatus()` and `TM_GridChangeVector()` from `AGameTurnManagerBase`. These functions were simple wrappers around `ADungeonFloorGenerator` methods and created confusion with duplicate functionality in `AGridPathfindingLibrary`. Blueprint code should use `GetFloorGenerator()->ReturnGridStatus()` or `GetFloorGenerator()->GridChangeVector()` directly instead (2025-11-15 22:30)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00010-R1` - Removed redundant wrapper function `ExecuteSimultaneousMoves()` from `AGameTurnManagerBase`. This function was a simple wrapper that only called `ExecuteSimultaneousPhase()` and was unused (no C++ call sites, not exposed to Blueprint). Code should call `ExecuteSimultaneousPhase()` directly instead (2025-11-15 22:45)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00011-R1` - Fixed garbled and Japanese comments in `GameTurnManagerBase.h` and `GameTurnManagerBase.cpp`, translated all comments to English. Fixed encoding issues including garbled characters (繁E 縺, ☁E, etc.) and converted Japanese documentation to English for better maintainability (2025-11-15 23:45)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00012-R1` - Translated all Japanese text in log messages within `GameTurnManagerBase.cpp` to English. Fixed garbled characters in log messages (ↁE, ☁E, ✁E, etc.) and converted Japanese log text to English for consistency (2025-11-15 23:50)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00013-R1` - Translated remaining Japanese comments in `GameTurnManagerBase.cpp` to English. Fixed approximately 200+ Japanese comments throughout the file, including command processing, movement validation, occupancy checks, and helper functions. Work in progress - approximately 157 comments remaining (2025-11-15 23:55)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00014-R1` - Removed ALL Japanese comments from `GameTurnManagerBase.cpp`. Deleted approximately 164 lines containing Japanese characters or garbled text (☁E, ↁE, ✁E, etc.) to clean up the codebase. All Japanese comment lines have been completely removed (2025-11-15 23:58)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00015-R1` - Created unified movement validation API `IsMoveValid()` in `AGridPathfindingLibrary` consolidating Chebyshev distance (8-directional), terrain walkability, corner-cutting prevention, and occupancy checks. Refactored `AGameTurnManagerBase::OnPlayerCommandAccepted_Implementation()` to use new API (removed ~70 lines of inline validation logic). Simplified `AUnitBase::MoveUnit()` to delegate to `UUnitMovementComponent`, removed obsolete `StartNextLeg()` and `UpdateMove()` implementations (171 lines removed). Translated all Japanese comments in `GridPathfindingLibrary.cpp` to English (44 comment lines fixed). Files modified: `Grid/GridPathfindingLibrary.h`, `Grid/GridPathfindingLibrary.cpp`, `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.cpp`, `Character/UnitBase.h`, `Character/UnitBase.cpp` (2025-11-16 13:55)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00016-R1` - Integrated `IsMoveValid()` API into AI decision-making pipeline. Replaced manual Chebyshev distance calculations with `FGridUtils::ChebyshevDistance()` in `UEnemyAISubsystem::BuildObservations()` and `UEnemyThinkerBase::ComputeIntent_Implementation()`. Added IsMoveValid validation in `ComputeIntent_Implementation()` to verify AI movement intentions before committing, preventing invalid moves (corner-cutting, terrain blocking, occupancy conflicts). AI now falls back to Wait intent when proposed move is rejected. Files modified: `AI/Enemy/EnemyAISubsystem.cpp`, `AI/Enemy/EnemyThinkerBase.cpp` (2025-11-16 14:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00017-R1` - Fixed swap move blocking in `UConflictResolverSubsystem`. Reversed swap detection logic to ALLOW swap moves instead of blocking them. When Actor A moves to cell B and Actor B moves to cell A (swap pattern detected), both moves are now permitted instead of forcing both actors to Wait. Updated resolution reason from "Blocked by swap detection" to "Swap move allowed". This fixes the issue where player moves were incorrectly canceled when swapping positions with enemies. Files modified: `Turn/ConflictResolverSubsystem.cpp` (2025-11-16 14:10)
  - `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00018-R1` - Rebound `UGA_MoveBase` to the new `UUnitMovementComponent::OnMoveFinished` delegate, ensuring `TurnBarrier` receives valid actor and action context after the movement refactor (2025-11-17 13:15)
  - `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00022-R1` - Added rotation handling in `UGA_MoveBase::OnMoveFinished` so actors face their movement direction and corrected `GA_MeleeAttack` to derive rotation from the attack direction (2025-11-17 19:00)
  - `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00023-R1` - Trigger sequential move-only intent execution after the attack phase completes so non-attacking enemies move before the enemy turn ends (2025-11-17 19:15)
  - `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00019-R1` - Removed 16 wrapper functions from `AGameTurnManagerBase` as part of refactoring plan section 6. Phase 1: Removed 8 unused functions (`BuildAllObservations`, `SendGameplayEventWithResult`, `SendGameplayEvent`, `GetPlayerController_TBS`, `GetPlayerPawnCachedOrFetch`, `EnsureFloorGenerated`, `NextFloor`, `WarpPlayerToStairUp`). Phase 2: Replaced internal calls to `GetPlayerPawn()` (6 locations), `CollectEnemies()` (3 locations), `CollectIntents()` (1 location), and `HasAnyAttackIntent()` (3 locations) with direct subsystem calls. Phase 3: Removed function declarations and implementations for replaced functions. Phase 4: Removed `GetDungeonSystem()` and `GetFloorGenerator()` wrappers. All wrapper functions now replaced with direct subsystem access (`UGameplayStatics`, `EnemyAISubsystem`, `EnemyTurnDataSubsystem`, `DungeonSystem` member). Files modified: `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.h`, `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.cpp` (2025-11-16 15:30)
  - `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00024-R1` - Registered enemy move actions with `TurnActionBarrierSubsystem` and completed them when the manual `OnMoveFinished` delegate fires so the barrier waits for all units before ending the turn (2025-11-17 19:20)
  - `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00025-R1` - Converted attack intents to wait before dispatching the sequential move-only phase so those intents no longer trigger attacks again and all move/wait actions are properly tracked by the barrier (2025-11-17 19:25)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00020-R1` - Declared `TryGetASC`/`GetTeamIdOf` before their use and localized enemy subsystem references while building observations so `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.cpp` compiles without duplicate definitions after the movement refactor (2025-11-17 14:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00021-R1` - Separated responsibilities of `AGridPathfindingLibrary` as part of refactoring plan section 7. Phase 1: Removed unused `IsCellWalkableAtWorldPosition()` wrapper function. Phase 2: Replaced all `IsCellWalkable()` calls (5 locations) with `IsCellWalkableIgnoringActor()` in `DistanceFieldSubsystem.cpp`, `EnemyThinkerBase.cpp`, `EnemyAISubsystem.cpp`, and `GA_MoveBase.cpp`, then removed `IsCellWalkable()` and `DoesCellContainBlockingActor()` helper function. Phase 3: Replaced `GetActorsAtGridPosition()` calls (3 locations) with direct `UGridOccupancySubsystem` access in `DetectInExpandingVision()`, `DetectInRadius()`, and `SearchAdjacentTiles()`, removed `GetActorAtPosition()` and `GetActorsAtGridPosition()` functions, removed `ReturnGridStatusIgnoringSelf()` function. Phase 4: Removed static distance functions (`GetChebyshevDistance()`, `GetManhattanDistanceGrid()`, `GetEuclideanDistanceGrid()`) - use `FGridUtils` directly. All fallback logic using `TActorIterator` removed. `AGridPathfindingLibrary` now focused solely on pathfinding and terrain management, with clear separation from `UGridOccupancySubsystem`. Files modified: `Grid/GridPathfindingLibrary.h`, `Grid/GridPathfindingLibrary.cpp`, `Turn/DistanceFieldSubsystem.cpp`, `AI/Enemy/EnemyThinkerBase.cpp`, `AI/Enemy/EnemyAISubsystem.cpp`, `Abilities/GA_MoveBase.cpp` (2025-11-17 15:40)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00026-R1` - Fixed garbled Japanese comments (mojibake) in `GA_MoveBase.h` as part of architecture improvement plan Phase 1. Converted file encoding to UTF-8 (BOM-less) and corrected all garbled Japanese comments throughout the file. Fixed approximately 20+ comment lines including class description, function comments, and section headers. All comments are now readable and properly encoded. Files modified: `Abilities/GA_MoveBase.h` (2025-11-16 00:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00027-R1` - Migrated grid pathfinding functionality from `AGridPathfindingLibrary` Actor to `UGridPathfindingSubsystem` as part of architecture improvement plan Phase 2. Created new `UGridPathfindingSubsystem` class inheriting from `UWorldSubsystem` with all pathfinding functionality. Updated `GameTurnManagerBase::HandleDungeonReady()` to initialize Subsystem. Added `GetGridPathfindingSubsystem()` accessor methods to `GameTurnManagerBase` and `GA_MoveBase`. Removed PathFinder Actor spawning from `TBSLyraGameMode::SpawnBootstrapActors()`. Legacy `GetCachedPathFinder()` methods kept for backward compatibility during migration. Files modified: `Grid/GridPathfindingSubsystem.h` (new), `Grid/GridPathfindingSubsystem.cpp` (new), `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.h`, `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.cpp`, `Abilities/GA_MoveBase.h`, `Abilities/GA_MoveBase.cpp`, `Turn/TBSLyraGameMode.cpp` (2025-11-16 00:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00028-R1` - Replaced `CurrentTurnIndex` with `CurrentTurnId` in `AGameTurnManagerBase` as part of architecture improvement plan Phase 3.1. Replaced all log messages and critical logic to use `CurrentTurnId` from `UTurnFlowCoordinator` instead of local `CurrentTurnIndex`. `CurrentTurnIndex` is now synchronized with `TurnFlowCoordinator->GetCurrentTurnIndex()` for backward compatibility but no longer used in core logic. Replication and synchronization logic for `CurrentTurnIndex` kept for transition period. Updated approximately 40+ log messages and function calls. Files modified: `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.cpp` (2025-11-16 00:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00029-R1` - Removed `CachedPlayerPawn` member variable from `AGameTurnManagerBase` as part of architecture improvement plan Phase 3.2. Replaced all 55 usages with local `APawn* PlayerPawn = UGameplayStatics::GetPlayerPawn(GetWorld(), 0)` calls in each function that needs player pawn access. Updated functions: `InitializeTurnSystem`, `CollectEnemies` (3 instances), `GetPlayerASC`, `OnTurnStartedHandler`, `ContinueTurnAfterInput`, `ExecuteMovePhase`, `NotifyPlayerPossessed`. Removed caching assignments and member variable declaration. All player pawn accesses now use direct `GetPlayerPawn()` calls instead of cached reference. Files modified: `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.h`, `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.cpp`, `Documentation/CODE_REVISION.md` (2025-11-16 00:00)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00030-R1` - Completed migration from `AGridPathfindingLibrary` to `UGridPathfindingSubsystem` in movement components and abilities. Updated `UUnitMovementComponent::MoveUnitAlongGridPath()` to remove `AGridPathfindingLibrary*` parameter and use subsystem internally. Updated `UUnitMovementComponent::FinishMovement()` to use `UGridPathfindingSubsystem` for grid operations. Migrated all `GetPathFinder()` calls in `GA_MoveBase` to `GetGridPathfindingSubsystem()` (10+ locations). Updated function signatures: `ComputeFixedZ()` now accepts `const UGridPathfindingSubsystem*` instead of `const AGridPathfindingLibrary*`. Removed `CachedPathFinder` member variable from `GA_MoveBase`. Updated forward declarations in headers. All movement validation and grid operations now use the new subsystem architecture. Deprecated `GetPathFinder()` function kept for backward compatibility during transition. Files modified: `Character/UnitMovementComponent.h`, `Character/UnitMovementComponent.cpp`, `Abilities/GA_MoveBase.h`, `Abilities/GA_MoveBase.cpp`, `Documentation/CODE_REVISION.md` (2025-11-16 23:55)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00031-R1` - Cleaned up duplicate and deprecated movement-related functions. Removed unused `CalculateNextTilePosition()` function from `GA_MoveBase` (no call sites found). Removed deprecated `GA_MoveBase::GetPathFinder()` function (replaced by `GetGridPathfindingSubsystem()`). Replaced legacy `GridChangeVector()` call with `SetGridCostAtWorldPosition()` in `GA_MoveBase::UpdateGridState()`. Added usage comments to `SnapToCellCenter()` and `SnapToCellCenterFixedZ()` functions to clarify they return coordinates only and do not move actors (use `GridUtils::SnapActorToGridCell()` for actor movement). Files modified: `Abilities/GA_MoveBase.h`, `Abilities/GA_MoveBase.cpp`, `Documentation/CODE_REVISION.md` (2025-01-XX XX:XX)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00032-R1` - Removed duplicate and legacy PathFinder accessor functions. Replaced all `GetCachedPathFinder()` calls with `GetGridPathfindingSubsystem()` (2 locations: `GameTurnManagerBase.cpp`, `PlayerControllerBase.cpp`). Removed `GetCachedPathFinder()` function declaration and implementation. Removed `CachedPathFinder` member variable from `GameTurnManagerBase` (kept `PathFinder` only). Removed legacy PathFinder Actor initialization code from `HandleDungeonReady()` (PathFinder is now Subsystem, not Actor). Cleaned up `ResolveOrSpawnPathFinder()` function with clarifying comments. Removed `FindGridLibrary()` helper function from `GA_MeleeAttack.cpp` (replaced with direct `GetSubsystem()` calls). Replaced `GetCurrentTurnIndex()` usage in `PlayerControllerBase.cpp` with `TurnFlowCoordinator->GetCurrentTurnIndex()`. Removed `TBSLyraGameMode::GetPathFinder()` function (no call sites, PathFinder is now Subsystem). Files modified: `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.h`, `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.cpp`, `Player/PlayerControllerBase.cpp`, `Abilities/GA_MeleeAttack.cpp`, `Turn/TBSLyraGameMode.h`, `Documentation/CODE_REVISION.md` (2025-01-XX XX:XX)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00033-R1` - Added `UTBSAttributeSet_Combat` AttributeSet class for TBS combat attributes. Provides common combat attributes: HP (Health/MaxHealth), Attack, Defense, Speed, Accuracy, Evasion, Crit (CritChance/CritMultiplier), and Damage modifiers (DamageDealtRate/DamageTakenRate). Follows Lyra GAS patterns with `ATTRIBUTE_ACCESSORS` macro and proper replication. Initialized with `SetBaseValue()` in constructor. Files modified: `Character/TBSAttributeSet_Combat.h` (new), `Character/TBSAttributeSet_Combat.cpp` (new), `Documentation/CODE_REVISION.md` (2025-01-XX XX:XX)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00034-R1` - Added `PreAttributeChange()` and `PostGameplayEffectExecute()` override functions to `UTBSAttributeSet_Combat`. `PreAttributeChange()` clamps Health attribute between 0 and MaxHealth. `PostGameplayEffectExecute()` checks for death condition when Health reaches 0 or below (includes TODO for death tag/event handling). Files modified: `Character/TBSAttributeSet_Combat.h`, `Character/TBSAttributeSet_Combat.cpp`, `Documentation/CODE_REVISION.md` (2025-01-XX XX:XX)
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00035-R1` - Added `UTBSDamageExecution` custom damage calculation class for TBS. Implements `Execute_Implementation()` to calculate damage using Attack, Defense, Crit (CritChance/CritMultiplier), and damage modifiers (DamageDealtRate/DamageTakenRate) from `TBSAttributeSet_Combat`. Includes `FTBSDamageStatics` structure for attribute capture definitions. Supports SetByCaller.Damage tag for skill power specification.

  - `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00030-R3` - Ensured GA_MoveBase completes its registered TurnActionBarrierSubsystem action when the ability ends so player moves release the barrier and the turn can advance. Files modified: `Abilities/GA_MoveBase.cpp`, `Documentation/CODE_REVISION.md` (2025-11-17 01:00)
  - `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00030-R4` - Registered wait actions with TurnActionBarrierSubsystem and marked them complete immediately so idle moves no longer leave the barrier stuck in-progress. Files modified: `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.cpp`, `Documentation/CODE_REVISION.md` (2025-11-17 01:00)
  - `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00030-R5` - Split attack and move completion callbacks in `GameTurnManagerBase` so `AttackPhaseExecutorSubsystem::OnFinished` triggers the sequential move phase while the barrier callback only ends the turn. Files modified: `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.h`, `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.cpp`, `Documentation/CODE_REVISION.md` (2025-11-17 02:00)
  - `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00030-R6` - Delay `EndEnemyTurn()` after barrier completion using `SetTimer` to avoid racing with `GA_MoveBase::EndAbility` tag cleanup so `CanAdvanceTurn()` sees clean state. Files modified: `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.cpp`, `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.h`, `Documentation/CODE_REVISION.md` (2025-11-17 02:55)
  - `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00030-R7` - Keep resolved wait actions flowing through `TurnCorePhaseManager::CoreExecutePhase` so they reach `DispatchResolvedMove`, ensuring the barrier registration/completion logic runs before Wait intents hit GAS. Files modified: `Turn/TurnCorePhaseManager.cpp`, `Documentation/CODE_REVISION.md` (2025-11-17 01:50)

  - `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00030-R8` - Refactor `GA_MoveBase` so it only executes the ConflictResolver-provided `TargetCell`, and update `GameTurnManagerBase` to trigger the ability with that encoded cell while `OnPlayerCommandAccepted` now only acknowledges the command. Files modified: `Abilities/GA_MoveBase.cpp`, `Turn/GameTurnManagerBase.cpp`, `Documentation/CODE_REVISION.md` (2025-11-17 01:50)

- CodeRevision: INC-2025-00016-R1 - Added barrier initialization before attack execution and dropped stale OnAttacksFinished notifications to keep GA_AttackBase synchronized.
- CodeRevision: INC-2025-00016-R2 - Added occupancy retry logic in AUnitBase::StartNextLeg() and UGA_MoveBase::OnMoveFinished() to retry UpdateActorCell() before broadcasting completion.
## Usage Guidelines

### Format

When making code changes, add a comment near the modified code using the following format:

```
CodeRevision: <ID> (<Description>) (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
```

Example:
```cpp
// CodeRevision: INC-2025-00002-R1 (Added retry logic for pathfinding) (2025-11-10 17:32)
void SomeFunction() {
    // ...
}
```

### Workflow

1. **When making changes**: Create a new `CodeRevision` entry and add it as a comment near the relevant file sections.
2. **Update documentation**: Update this file with the latest `CodeRevision` entry, including the target file, purpose, and timestamp.
3. **Consistency**: Include the same tag in both code comments and this file, so that changes can be verified together with the version and timing.

### For External Agents

When working on this project (including Claude Code and other AI assistants):
- Always check this file before making changes
- Follow the CodeRevision format when modifying code
- Update this log file with your changes

## Recording Guidelines

- New `CodeRevision` entries should follow the format: `CodeRevision: <ID> ? <Description> (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)`, and be added as comments near the relevant code.

**Usage Policy**
1. When making changes, create a new `CodeRevision` entry and add it as a comment near the relevant file sections.
2. Update this file with the latest `CodeRevision` and the target file/purpose, so that changes can be tracked across sessions.
3. Include the same tag in both comments and this file, so that changes can be verified together with the version and timing.

## Recent Fixes

- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00001-R1` - `AGameTurnManagerBase::ExecuteAttacks()` now notifies `Barrier->BeginTurn()` before invoking attacks so GA_AttackBase receives a valid turn ID.
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00001-R2` - `AGameTurnManagerBase::OnAttacksFinished()` drops stale turn notifications instead of processing them, preventing outdated attack states from corrupting the turn flow.
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00002-R1` - `AUnitBase::StartNextLeg()` now retries `UGridOccupancySubsystem::UpdateActorCell()` on failure (0.1s timer) instead of logging a critical error, and only broadcasts `OnMoveFinished` after the occupancy commit succeeds.
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00002-R2` - `UGA_MoveBase::OnMoveFinished()` mirrors the occupancy retry behavior so ability completion waits for a successful grid commit instead of rolling back.
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00018-R1` - Rebound `UGA_MoveBase` delegates to `UnitMovementComponent::OnMoveFinished` so barrier completion notifications carry alive actor/action context after the 2025-11-16 movement refactor.
- `CodeRevision: INC-2025-00006-R1` - Removed unused legacy functions from `AGameTurnManagerBase`: `RunTurn()` (hardcoded turn loop replaced by `TurnFlowCoordinator`), `ProcessPlayerCommand()` (private method replaced by `CommandHandler->ProcessPlayerCommand()`), and `StartTurnMoves()` (unused function). These functions were identified as obsolete after the refactoring to use specialized subsystems.
